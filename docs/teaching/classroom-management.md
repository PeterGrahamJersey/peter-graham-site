# Classroom Management
Having a plan is your main advantage in classroom management (one of the areas I, and I think everyone struggles with). Here is my current plan.

## My Plan
### Philosophy
- Agression (shouting) is a loss of control, not a strategy
- Isolation / long detentions don't teach things
- You get more of what you pay attention to
- Don't conflate praise and consequence i.e. no earning off consequences
- Back yourself / ask for help if unsure

### My rules
- Ready - ready to learn
- Respect - especially others answers/mistakes
- Safe

### Praise
- Loudly narrating the positive
- Recognition board - goal for every student to try to achieve
    - Whole class on it -> tick on chart (consistent w/ dept)
- Over and above
    - -> P point (consistent w/ school)
    - -> Positive note home
    - -> Positive call home (schedule weekly time)

### Managing misbehaviour
- If immediately disruptive
    - Non-verbal
    - Non-personal comment
    - Quick verbal warning
- If can wait / after initial resolution
    - 1:1 30s intervention - see script
    - Move seat if possible
    - C1
    - If continues - park + C2

#### 30-second intervention script

## Policy
### School
- Praise focused
    - Praise points that lead to awards and rewards
- Consequences (goal is to prevent rapid escalation)
    - Warning 
    - Move seat & C1 - 15 mins that lunchtime/breaktime, dept or class teacher
    - 'Park' to another classroom, email oncall, & C2 - 30 min after school
    - On call, reflection room & C3 - 45 mins (w/ SLT?)
    - Might be a separate SLT tier of detentions
    - Can reduce by 10 mins w/ reflection
- Reports system that works its way through diff staff, tutor -> head

#### Other points
- Phones - if you see it inside, you confiscate it
- Toilet - students can go in P2 and P4 at discretion of teacher
- Slightly different processes for lateness / uniform

### Department
- Praise 'charts' - classes earn ticks that lead to biscuits / pirate game approx once per half term.
