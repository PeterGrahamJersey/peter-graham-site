# Planner
Organisation is essential as a teacher. Here's how I've set up my planner.

### Digital planner.
- Syncs across multiple devices
- Searchable + can add images / files / links
- I use digital notes for my personal notes, so it's more familiar to how I work

### Onenote.
- School using the microsoft suite, so syncs well across personal and work devices

#### On Checklists
- Checklists help all sorts of professions avoid missing things
- Teaching can be overwheling, at the end of the day a checklist ensures you haven't forgotten anything essential, even when your brain is fried.
