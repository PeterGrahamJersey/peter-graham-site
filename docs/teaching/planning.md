# Planning

- Where time allows, plan units of learning cycles instead of individual lessons.

### Goal Timings (to plan)
Aim for 30 mins max to plan a regular lesson.

- Do Now (<5 mins)
- Retrieval / Exit ticket (<5 mins)
- Explanation & Practice (10 mins)
- Explanation & Practice OR different task (10 mins)
- Stretch Q (< 5 mins)
- Exit question (<5 mins)
