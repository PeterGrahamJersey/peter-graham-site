1 week done, it went smoother than expected. Looking back at my preparation what worked and what didn't?

<!--truncate-->

## Classroom
- Whiteboard packs working much smoother than whiteboards in a box
- Added a glue stick to the whiteboard packs
- I need to remember to set clearer expectations for when the whiteboards  go away in-between tasks
- Needed a tub for each class, thought I didn’t but should’ve listened.

## Planner
- Working well
- Definitely prefer writing consequences in it w/ a reason instead of on the board
- So much information to keep track of, finding my inbox is much clearer when I use a digital planner
- Haven’t planned my frees yet, going to do this with a bit more of a sense of how my weeks work

## 1st week of lessons
- Would’ve helped, but I couldn’t bring myself to do this in that final weekend
- Anything is a win - I had 1 year group's lessons planned which helped

## Seating plans
- I think I started to adapt these too soon, could’ve maybe let them stay in that place for a week before taking on any requests

## Routines
- The basics are there but I need to tighten them up, need to rehearse them next week
- I sort of introduced finger voting, but didn’t introduce it very well
- I think my entries are pretty solid, but I’m spending a bit too long on the do now
- Volume is my main area to get clearer in my head
- Behaviour / Praise - recognition board was too much of a challenge in week 1 before knowing any students names, going to push this in week 2

## Lunches
- Having a few in school really helped, needed a snack in school for breaktime too + some oat milk

## Checklists
- Mine need some updating, but are helpful when your brain is fried

## What I could’ve added:
- Phonecalls
- Remember to check the difficulty of worksheets - especially decimals
- Put a bit of time in to wander round other classrooms (if you can spare the time)
- Check all your log-ins are working - I didn’t have access to our SEN info initially
