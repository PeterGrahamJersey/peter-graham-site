# Before it all kicks off

What to prepare before back to school? As an ECT 1 there's a sense of peace in my own ignorance. Even with a headstart of 5 weeks before summer I've not done this before and I don't know many of the students. Seating plans are going to be guesses, and while I can (and need to) do some planning I won't know what will work for each class until I start teaching them.

Asking a few teachers got the following advice:

1. Sort your classroom

- If you have your own classroom, go into school and spend some time on it.
- There won't be time on inset days to do this
- Make sure you have a key for it
- Make sure you've got the equipment you need
- Get the tech (whiteboard) working

2. Prepare your planner

- I'm going to use a digital planner, but whatever you use, set it up now
- Plan a free for ECT work
- Plan at least 1/2 a free for contact home

3. Plan at least your first week of lessons

4. Sort your seating plans

My additions:

5. Plan your routines

- Routines I've chosen to start with: whiteboards, entry, exit, behaviour (focused on praise)
- Routines that will follow: partner talk, retrieval, homework

6. Plan snacks/lunches

- What will you eat when you don't have time / don't want to do a food shop

7. Plan my end of day checklist

- What will I need to do at the end of every day before I want to leave
