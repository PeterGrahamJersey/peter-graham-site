2 weeks down. The job is fun, the planning was overwhelming this week.

## WWW / EBI

- 'recognition board' / a more consistent approach to praise

## Planning
Planning was something that I worked on a lot during the PGCE, but it really feels like I've regressed. Towards the end of the PGCE it took me 30-40 mins to plan a lesson, but now I'm back to well over an hour. This is partly due to not setting effective boundaries, planning is a challenge as it expands to fill whatever time you give it. This week it ate up pretty much all of my personal and social time, leaving me exhausted by the end of the week. Even worse, planning while tired is slow and leads to lessons that aren't any better than ones you spend half the time on.

### My new plan:
- Set myself 'working hours' - I will be in school 0700-17:30 (4pm if I have an appointment or it's a Friday) and won't work at home during the week.
- Max 3 hours of work on a weekend.
- The goal is to reduce these further, but even sticking to them would be a drastic improvement.

Let's see how it goes.
