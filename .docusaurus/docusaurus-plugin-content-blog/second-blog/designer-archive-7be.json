In Shriek I intended to create a small-town, bleak UK one-shot, that left space for the game master to get creative. Shriek was edited by Dale Blackburn, and was helped by layout feedback from the Explorers Design discord.\n\n![FIST Screenshot](./deathcester-demo-1.jpg)\n\n![FIST Screenshot](./deathcester-demo-2.jpg)\n\n![FIST Screenshot](./deathcester-demo-3.jpg)\n\n![FIST Screenshot](./deathcester-demo-4.jpg)"
