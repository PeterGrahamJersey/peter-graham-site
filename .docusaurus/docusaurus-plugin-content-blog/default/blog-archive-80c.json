Even with a headstart of 5 weeks before summer I've not done this before and I don't know many of the students. Seating plans are going to be guesses, and while I can (and need to) do some planning I won't know what will work for each class until I start teaching them.\n\nAsking a few teachers got the following advice:\n\n1. Sort your classroom\n\n- If you have your own classroom, go into school and spend some time on it.\n- There won't be time on inset days to do this\n- Make sure you have a key for it\n- Make sure you've got the equipment you need\n- Get the tech (whiteboard) working\n\n2. Prepare your planner\n\n- I'm going to use a digital planner, but whatever you use, set it up now\n- Plan a free for ECT work\n- Plan at least 1/2 a free for contact home\n\n3. Plan at least your first week of lessons\n\n4. Sort your seating plans\n\nMy additions:\n\n5. Plan your routines\n\n- Routines I've chosen to start with: whiteboards, entry, exit, behaviour (focused on praise)\n- Routines that will follow: partner talk, retrieval, homework\n\n6. Plan snacks/lunches\n\n- What will you eat when you don't have time / don't want to do a food shop\n\n7. Plan my end of day checklist\n\n- What will I need to do at the end of every day before I want to leave"
