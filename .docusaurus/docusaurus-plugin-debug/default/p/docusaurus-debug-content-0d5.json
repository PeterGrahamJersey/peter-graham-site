They are however a helpful basis for how to start to implement culture. They also reminded me how the kind of culture I want might look in practice.\n\n**Relevant motivating questions**\n- What is my vision for culture? *and what is it grounded in?*\n- How do you develop culture in a secondary classroom?\n\n## Teaching and learning\nAs the core activity in the classroom, how you approach teaching and learning should reflect the culture that you want to develop.\n\n### 1. Make mistakes welcome\nIn my experience, fear of making mistakes often appears to hold less confident students back. Teaching a class to make mistakes, and accept others mistakes is a core part of the culture I want to build. \n\n*This is also discussed by Barton (2018, 11.2) and Lemov (2015) as a \"culture of error\".*\n\n### 2. Whole class response\nMy PGCE advocated for seeking whole class response, or at least a pair/share where possible. Culturally my goal is for all students to feel like their opinion is valued and that they have the space to share it. Prioritising whole-class approaches over individual questioning helps reflect this. Individual questioning remains an essential tool that I will continue to use, but my focus will be building clear routines for the other techniques.\n\n*Barton (2018) advocates for whole class response, and Rosenshine (2012) says 'ask a large number of questions and seek answers from all students'.*\n\n## Classroom management\nClassroom management is often conflated with classroom culture. I feel that how you manage a classroom should reflect the culture you want, not define it.\n\n### 3. Relationships\nMy tutor was fond of the quote \"Teachers are in the business of relationships\". Cultivating positive relationships with effective boundaries is essential to teaching. These relationships need to be able to survive conflict (i.e. behaviour / sanctions). Relationships should reflect and reinforce your culture at a personal level. \n\n*Dix's (2017) 30s intervention has proved a useful model for me to communicate boundaries before consequences, this helps maintain to maintain the relationship with the student even in conflict.*\n\n### 4. Routine\nOutside of relationships, the classroom management approach suggested by my PGCE focused on consistency, high expectations and clear boundaries. Being consistent is challenging both within a school and from lesson to lesson. Routine seems to be the main way to build and embed culture in your classroom. In defining a vision and values for my classroom I hope it will help my routines to more consistently reflect the culture that I want.\n\n*Dix (2017) low stakes rehearsal is how I intend to implement routines in future. The Tom Bennett (2016) resources for trainees highlight needing to teach routines.*\n\n### 5. Response\nMy PGCE tutor emphasised the importance of loud praise, quiet correction. Where you require an immediate response to demonstrate a boundary you issue the reminder / sanction concisely and move on as objectively as possible. Teachers direct attention, and in building culture that attention should be directed at behaviours that we want to encourage. Therefore how you respond to the negative behaviours of a minority should draw as little attention as possible away from the positive values being shown by most students. Specifically praising cultural values in action is likely to be a core part of getting students thinking about the culture I want within my classroom, and getting them to remember it.\n\n*This approach is reinforced by Dix's (2017) 30s intervention, Lemov's (2015) \"narrate the positive\", and by Willingham's (2021) \"memory is the residue of thought\".*\n\n### 6. You are playing the long game\nThe PGCE focused on relationships, behaviour and routine, but it applies to culture more generally. Establishing a culture will take time and consistency. Defining the values I want upfront should allow me to plan consistent routines that will work towards a desired culture. This is a different approach to the the less-planned cultures that have emerged in my current classes.\n\n*Bennet (2016) talks about routines taking time to become habit, Dix (2017) also emphasises allowing time for routines to be established.*\n\n### 7. You work within a wider system\nParticularly during the PGCE, you have no influence over the school's policies or existing culture. You do your best to follow the existing approach while also trying out your own ideas. As an ECT, this is much the same, but you now balance supporting your colleagues through school-wide consistency with your own goals for your classroom. Any approach to culture I take should use the school values and routines as much as possible. I should share my thinking with my team and more broadly to get a more varied insight into what makes an effective culture and spot opportunities for collaboration.\n\n## References\n- Barton, C.

While their many goals ensured that my practice has improved, I cannot help but feel that I've not spent enough time thinking about how it all fits together. What do I want my classroom to feel like? And how do I get it there?\n\nThis is not to say that the culture in my class is all bad. It tries to emphasise positives, welcome mistakes and prioritise thinking over an unjustified answer. But at the end of the year it still feels too influenced by the classes previous culture or their mood on a given day instead of my own efforts.\n\nIt is possible that this is me being blind to our progress, or that this is always the way with teaching. But regardless, I need a clearer vision and evidence base for the culture of my classroom. \n\nChanging an established culture takes time, but with the start of a new academic year comes a rare opportunity for a reset. I aim to create a plan for my classroom culture in time for the start of the new school year. One that goes beyond a few slides in a welcome back lesson and is grounded in some, ideally evidenced, principles.\n\nMotivating questions:\n- What is my vision for culture? *and what is it grounded in?*\n- How do you develop culture in a secondary classroom?\n- How do you develop culture in a team of adults? *and how does it differ with a class?*\n- What do primary schools do to establish culture? *and can we use this in secondary schools?*\n- How do you work with your department, other departments and wider school to build and maintain culture?"},{"id":"week-3-motivating-students","metadata":{"permalink":"/teacher/week-3-motivating-students","source":"@site/blog/2023-09-25-week-3.md","title":"Week 3 - motivating students","description":"How do you motivate those who choose to just do nothing?","date":"2023-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":1.665,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"week-3-motivating-students","title":"Week 3 - motivating students","unlisted":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Class Culture - Motivation","permalink":"/teacher/class-culture-motivation"},"nextItem":{"title":"Week 2 - over-planning","permalink":"/teacher/week-2-over-planning"}},"content":"How do you motivate those who choose to just do nothing?\n\n<!--truncate-->\n\n### What is working?\n- Not writing consequences on the board (I think), though behaviour has become a bit more challenging\n- Checklists for start / end lesson things to do\n- Digital planner\n- Boundaries - last week\n- My ability to deliver a 5-period day and keep smiling\n- Oat Milk in the maths office\n\n### What needs work?\n- Planning and boundaries\n- Higher expectations for work?\n- Coaching point: saving time when handing out sheets\n\nThe planning remains the biggest challenge. Last week, I managed to stick to the  working hours that I set myself and felt so much better. But it just takes one day to feel significantly worst. After a v busy weekend (wedding + tough mudder) the start of this week feels out of control again. It feels like I spent too long on Friday thinking about how to approach units I hadn't taught before and instead I should've just used  that time to churn out lessons as quickly as possible. It also feels like there's no time to second guess any of your choices, but I doubt every choice that I make when it comes to planning.\n\nI'm experimenting with delivering the pre-planned lessons almost exactly as they are for my y7 classes, so I get a better sense of which bits I'd adapt. This is mostly working for the higher set Y7's but still feels limited on the quantity front of basics / processes.\n\nUnsure how to support students that choose not to do any work at all. Some options:\n- 'Parking' - might benefit other students, seems unlikely to develop any sort of motivation\n- Contact home - delicate balance of my job to figure it out vs home knowing that student much better than I ever will, time consuming\n- Speak to other teachers - time consuming\n- Seating plan - isolate if it's them or the people they're near"},{"id":"week-2-over-planning","metadata":{"permalink":"/teacher/week-2-over-planning","source":"@site/blog/2023-09-17-week-2.md","title":"Week 2 - over-planning","description":"2 weeks down.

Towards the end of the PGCE it took me 30-40 mins to plan a lesson, but now I'm back to well over an hour. This is partly due to not setting effective boundaries, planning is a challenge as it expands to fill whatever time you give it. This week it ate up pretty much all of my personal and social time, leaving me exhausted by the end of the week. Even worse, planning while tired is slow and leads to lessons that aren't any better than ones you spend half the time on.\n\n### My new plan:\n- Set myself 'working hours' - I will be in school 0700-17:30 (4pm if I have an appointment or it's a Friday) and won't work at home during the week.\n- Max 3 hours of work on a weekend.\n- The goal is to reduce these further, but even sticking to them would be a drastic improvement.\n\nLet's see how it goes."},{"id":"week-1-preparation-review","metadata":{"permalink":"/teacher/week-1-preparation-review","source":"@site/blog/2023-09-09-week-1.md","title":"Week 1 - preparation review","description":"1 week done, it went smoother than expected.
