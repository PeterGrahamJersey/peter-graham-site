Last week, I managed to stick to the  working hours that I set myself and felt so much better. But it just takes one day to feel significantly worst. After a v busy weekend (wedding + tough mudder) the start of this week feels out of control again. It feels like I spent too long on Friday thinking about how to approach units I hadn't taught before and instead I should've just used  that time to churn out lessons as quickly as possible. It also feels like there's no time to second guess any of your choices, but I doubt every choice that I make when it comes to planning.\n\nI'm experimenting with delivering the pre-planned lessons almost exactly as they are for my y7 classes, so I get a better sense of which bits I'd adapt. This is mostly working for the higher set Y7's but still feels limited on the quantity front of basics / processes.\n\nUnsure how to support students that choose not to do any work at all. Some options:\n- 'Parking' - might benefit other students, seems unlikely to develop any sort of motivation\n- Contact home - delicate balance of my job to figure it out vs home knowing that student much better than I ever will, time consuming\n- Speak to other teachers - time consuming\n- Seating plan - isolate if it's them or the people they're near"

Towards the end of the PGCE it took me 30-40 mins to plan a lesson, but now I'm back to well over an hour. This is partly due to not setting effective boundaries, planning is a challenge as it expands to fill whatever time you give it. This week it ate up pretty much all of my personal and social time, leaving me exhausted by the end of the week. Even worse, planning while tired is slow and leads to lessons that aren't any better than ones you spend half the time on.\n\n### My new plan:\n- Set myself 'working hours' - I will be in school 0700-17:30 (4pm if I have an appointment or it's a Friday) and won't work at home during the week.\n- Max 3 hours of work on a weekend.\n- The goal is to reduce these further, but even sticking to them would be a drastic improvement.\n\nLet's see how it goes."

Even with a headstart of 5 weeks before summer I've not done this before and I don't know many of the students. Seating plans are going to be guesses, and while I can (and need to) do some planning I won't know what will work for each class until I start teaching them.\n\n<!--truncate-->\n\nAsking a few teachers got the following advice:\n\n1. Sort your classroom\n\n- If you have your own classroom, go into school and spend some time on it.\n- There won't be time on inset days to do this\n- Make sure you have a key for it\n- Make sure you've got the equipment you need\n- Get the tech (whiteboard) working\n\n2. Prepare your planner\n\n- I'm going to use a digital planner, but whatever you use, set it up now\n- Plan a free for ECT work\n- Plan at least 1/2 a free for contact home\n\n3. Plan at least your first week of lessons\n\n4. Sort your seating plans\n\nMy additions:\n\n5. Plan your routines\n\n- Routines I've chosen to start with: whiteboards, entry, exit, behaviour (focused on praise)\n- Routines that will follow: partner talk, retrieval, homework\n\n6. Plan snacks/lunches\n\n- What will you eat when you don't have time / don't want to do a food shop\n\n7. Plan my end of day checklist\n\n- What will I need to do at the end of every day before I want to leave"
